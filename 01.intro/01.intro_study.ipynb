    "## So what is ML?\n",
    " - ML is a specific program to achieve specific tasks\n",
    " - Unlike non-ML programs, ML doesn't get the exact steps to solve a problem,but take some examples of the problem of solve, and figure it out how to solve it **itself** \n",
    "> As IBM researcher named Aruther Samuel noted in 1962 essay \"Artificial Intelligence: A Frontier of Automation\", ML needs 3 factors: **inputs, weights and update** - change weights to maximize performence.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### *Limits of ML*\n",
    "- A model cannot be created without data.\n",
    "- A model can only learn to operate on the patterns seen in the input data used to train it.\n",
    "- This learning approach only creates *predictions*, not recommended *actions*.\n",
    "- It's not enough to just have examples of input data; we need *labels* for that data too (e.g., pictures of dogs and cats aren't enough to train a model; we need a label for each one, saying which ones are dogs, and which are cats).\n",

    "## Emerge of Neural Network\n",
    " - Due to those limitations, Neural Network \n",
    " was introduced, when unlabeled data is given, itself updates its weights giving output trained all by itself.\n",
    "  - To achieve this,*stochastic gradient descent* (SGD) and universal approximation theorem are used.\n",
    "  - So, all we have to do is giving Network , data many as possible.\n",
